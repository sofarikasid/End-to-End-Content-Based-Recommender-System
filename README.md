# End-to-End-Content-Based-Recommender-System

### I'm thrilled to share with you my end-to-end development approach for building a powerful Content-Based Recommender System. I've implemented continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) using the GitHub ecosystem, and I'm leveraging the combination of FAST API, GitHub Actions,workflow, and Docker to create a smooth MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) pipeline. I hope you'll find this project helpful and informative!
